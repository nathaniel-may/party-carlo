# party-carlo
It's easy to assign the likelihood you think one person will attend a party, but it's harder to reason about a collection of probabilities to represent a group. This client-side web application will use your individual probabilites with Monte Carlo methods to compose them into a distribution that can be used to reason about the group as a whole with confidence intervals.
